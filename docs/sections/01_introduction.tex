\section{Introduction}

The Aadhaar ecosystem generates large-scale enrolment and update data on a daily basis.
Effective analysis of this data is critical for identifying operational risks, ensuring
service quality, and supporting informed decision-making.

This project, titled Aadhaar Predictive Operations and Risk Intelligence System (APORIS),
aims to transform raw Aadhaar data into actionable insights using structured analytics
and machine learning techniques.
